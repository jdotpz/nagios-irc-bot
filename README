This is a Nagios IRC bot that was written many years ago and I have carried with me from
job to job.  As noted, originally it was written by David D. Miller.  I do not claim
copyright over anything other than the portions I wrote, and as noted, this is licensed
under the Mozilla Public License.

The code is very old and relies on no-longer-supported Perl modules.  I don't recommend
this system be part of your crucial notification system, but as a nice-to-have, it's
pretty useful.

Configuration right now is done manually by editing the bot.  Look at the top of the
file and you'll see some information about nickname, location, etc.  If you search through
the rest of the file for "CONFIG" you'll see other spots you can configure.
